I am new to coding and this is my first project outside of a bootcamp. Feedback and suggestions will always be welcomed.

Color Puzzle is heavly inspired by the I Love Hue mobile app.

The game generates a pixelated color gradient then randomizes the position of each color block. The objective is for the user to rearrange the color blocks to match the solution color gradient.

Currently have the game built to the point of randomizing the color blocks. The next feature is to design the functionality to select a color block and swap it's position with another color block then check if the position all colors blocks matches the solution color gradient.
