I am new to coding and this is my first project outside of a bootcamp. Feedback and suggestions will always be welcomed.

Color Puzzle is heavly inspired by the I Love Hue mobile app.

The game generates a pixelated color gradient then randomizes the position of each color block. The objective is for the user to rearrange the color blocks to match the solution's color gradient.

The basic game design and logic is pretty much completed. Below are the features I plan to add:

- Add a counter to display the current number of moves after each block swap.
- Add end game stylization and prompt the user to reset/replay (not using browser alert meesages).
- Add more color gradients and allow the user to progress levels.
