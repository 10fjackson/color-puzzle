I am new to coding and this is my first project outside of a bootcamp. Feedback and suggestions will always be welcomed.

Color Puzzle is heavly inspired by the I Love Hue mobile app.

The game generates a pixelated color gradient then randomizes the position of each color block. The objective is for the user to rearrange the color blocks to match the solution color gradient.
